# Software Engineer Manager Tips

As a learning process, I'm using this repository for inspiration and safeguard some of work processes that it's been useful for my day-to-day work

## Inspirations

My mainly inspirational persons are [Simon Sinek](https://simonsinek.com) and [Brené Brown](https://brenebrown.com), though I love to get knowledge of anywhere, even LinkedIn

## Software

I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with some plugins to handle my daily notes, and gather information quickly in just one page makes it easy to follow up direct reports with meaning messages

In this repository you will find an Obsidian Vault ready to be used if you want to try it out. I save the files in my Dropbox (you can use any other cloud file hosting) and point my local vault to it, this way whatever device I use, I have always the latest version

## Direct Reports

I don't see myself as just managing work, I see it as managing people, performance, and growth while making sure the team delivers business value

My role is to align them with business goals, enable them to do their best work, help them grow, and build trust —> both ways!

To help me accomplish this, I try to follow 7 rules

### My own 7 rules

1. Set Clear Expectations
- Define each person's role and responsibilities
- Agree on goals, deadlines, and success criteria for their work together with the System Architect define [DoR and DoD](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/definition-vs-ready)
- Ensure they understand how their work ties into the bigger picture with the help of the Product Owner/Manager

2. Remove Roadblocks
- Identify technical or organizational blockers and address them quickly
- Secure resources (tools, infrastructure, access) so they can work effectively, like renewing licenses, access to parts of the company infrastructure, etc
- Shield them from unnecessary distractions or politics

3. Foster Growth & Development
- Conduct regular 1:1s focused not only on work updates but also on career aspirations
- Provide constructive feedback: timely, specific, and actionable.
- Offer opportunities for skill-building, whether through projects, training, or mentoring

4. Promote Healthy Team Culture
- Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Make sure workloads are balanced to prevent burnout
- Celebrate successes, both big launches and small wins

5. Monitor and Guide Performance
- Track progress toward objectives without micromanaging.
- Recognize good performance openly; address performance issues privately and promptly
- Use measurable data (velocity, quality metrics, etc.) to guide coaching, not just gut feelings

6. Be Their Advocate
- Represent their needs to higher management
- Give credit for their contributions in leadership meetings
- Support them during conflicts with other teams or stakeholders

7. Lead by Example
- Show technical and professional integrity
- Communicate transparently and follow through on commitments
- Demonstrate adaptability and calm under pressure

### Challenges

It is no easy task, people are different from each other, what works with one, might not work at all with the other. I always tend to come to the same example

```
Me: Hey <Developer>, how's your week going?
Direct-Report #1: It's been a busy one, but in a good way. I think the new caching approach will really speed things up, I'll show you in tomorrow's demo. Oh, and thanks again for connecting me with the mobile team, that's been super helpful.
```

vs

```
Me: Hey <Developer>, how's your week going?
Direct-Report #2: Same as last week, just working on what's assigned. You can check Jira for the latest updates.
```

I personally love the challenge, but at the end of the day, there are days that you're completely drained, and the next day you need to come to the office with a fresh face. I do tend to take days here and there to avoid depleting my battery for good

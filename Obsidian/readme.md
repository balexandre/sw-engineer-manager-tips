# Obsidian Vault Content

This vault was created as a template on how I use it to:
 - Capture daily notes effortlessly
 - Write important messages for my future self
 - Track and follow up on action points with ease
 - Organize thoughts before a 1:1 meeting
 - Reflect on what worked well, what could be improved, and where to grow

### Plugins used

- **Dataview** is a great plugin where everything in your vault is a datasource, so we can query anything, meaning, we can have data spread out by dates (Daily Notes) and easily create a page (Developer or Person in my case) with only their own data
- **Templater** is used to keep templates
- **Tasks** is a fantastic productivity tool as it comes with their own query language as well and fits right with `dataview`, also gives you a big range of options per task
- **Advanced Tables** help manage Markdown tables
- **Calendar** is something that I use to create my notes and gives a nice overview of the days I missed writing
- **Homepage** is set so when I close all pages and when I open Obsidian, shows me the [[What should I focus today]] page and I can quickly glance through my actions points and questions for the direct reports
- **Better Word Count** gives me some kind of peace, as it's better than the original counter, useful when I'm writing draft emails and I can quickly select the text and see how many words it has

### Current Setup

### How I use the `dataview` plugin

I have a Daily Notes template that is pre-build and I just need to delete what I don't use, and if I use, I don't need to remind myself how it works, I just fill the blanks

I use `dataview` variables for several areas
- Meetings, talks and 1-on-1s with: 
	- `edd` -> the yearly talk
	- `oneonone` -> 1:1 ([as we can't use numbers](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/#inline-fields) or the query will through a parser error)
	- `with` -> when meeting "with" someone
- In the developer page with:
	- `quickactions` -> what I write here, it will show in the HomePage (the [[What should I focus today]])

here are some examples with the data contained in this vault

in a quick glance, one could see some quick actions to do in a daily-bases or wait until the next 1:1

also, by gathering all actions points during the days, one can check what's missing and what has been done and when, if any one needs a new check, we can create a brand new action point on " today's " daily note

In the Person and Developer pages, I use almost the same technique, but specifying the person itself and we can quickly see a list of conversations and. when they occurred
